        <h2>ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li><strong>...</strong></li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .
                </li>
                <li>
                    For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.
                </li>
